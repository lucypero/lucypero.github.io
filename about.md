## Hi guys!

Hellope! I am Lucy!

I like systems programming and game development. My hope with this website is to be a place for interesting articles about stuff
I find cool or interesting, and for showing off some of the stuff I'm working on.

I'm also into video games quite a lot. Here's my [gaming log](/blog/gaming-log.html) where I log things about all the games I beat.

Check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/lucypero/) maybe

Also check out the game I released! Psycho Box.
