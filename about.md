## Hi guys!

Hellope! I am Lucy!

I like systems programming and game development. My hope with this website is to be a place for interesting articles about stuff
I find cool or interesting, and for showing off some of the stuff I'm working on.

Check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/lucypero/) maybe

## Things that I'm into right now

- Graphics rendering with wgpu and Vulkan
- House of the Dragon :crown:
- Coffee (french press) (black) :coffee:

## What I'm playing at the moment

- **God of War (2018)** - *prob one of my favorite games ever*
