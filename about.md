## Hi guys!

Hellope! I am Lucy!

I like systems programming and game development. My hope with this website is to be a place for interesting articles about stuff
I find cool or interesting, and for showing off some of the stuff I'm working on.

I'm also into video games quite a lot. 

Check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/lucypero/) maybe

## Things that I'm into right now

- 3D Graphics rendering with Direct3D 11 and C++. I am following [this book by Frank Luna](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-3D-Game-Programming-DirectX/dp/1936420228) for it.
- Trying really hard to get into the JRPG genre, like for example Final Fantasy, Shin Megami Tensei or Persona.
- Coffee (french press) (black) :coffee:

## What I'm playing at the moment

- **Final Fantasy VII (1997)** 

    i felt like this was one of the first games i should play, for my jrpg arc. i am mostly doing this for my insane idea of being more "cultured" in terms of the history of videogames, and more specifically jrpg's.
    but somehow i found a way to enjoy this really old and buggy game: lots of cheats activated, no random encounters (worst idea in game design), a 60 fps hack, and 2x play speed. this makes it so much more enjoyable and makes it
    way easier to enjoy the story. this might be my standard weapon for tackling all future old jrpg's.
