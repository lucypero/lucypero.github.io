## Hi guys!

Hellope! I am Lucy!

I like systems programming and game development. My hope with this website is to be a place for interesting articles about stuff
I find cool or interesting, and for showing off some of the stuff I'm working on.

I'm also into video games quite a lot. 

Check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/lucypero/) maybe

## Things that I'm into right now

- 3D Graphics rendering with Direct3D 11 and C++. I am following [this book by Frank Luna](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-3D-Game-Programming-DirectX/dp/1936420228) for it.
- Trying really hard to get into the JRPG genre, like for example Final Fantasy, Shin Megami Tensei or Persona.
- Coffee (french press) (black) :coffee:

## What I'm playing at the moment

- **The Legend of Dragoon (PSX) (1999)** 

    This is a really long game as I'm not used to the average length of a JRPG. I really have to slow down my brain's clock speed because i'm not used to slow turn based combat games like this one, so it is challenging to play for that reason. But I really enjoy it at times and I'm slowly getting used to playing JRPGs which was my goal.
