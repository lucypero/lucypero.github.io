## Hi guys!

Hellope! I am Lucy!

I like Rust and game development. My hope with this website is to be a place for interesting articles about stuff
I find cool or interesting, and for showing off some of the stuff I'm working on.

Check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/lucypero/) maybe

## Things that I'm into right now:

- Rust, obs :relieved: :nail_care: :crab:
- *When I say "Rust", I mean the programming language. And there's nothing else called "Rust" in this world so
  I don't know why I'm saying this.*
- [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)
- Hardcore gaminggg (keep reading)
- Game of Thrones :crown:
- Coffee (french press) (black) :coffee:

## What I'm playing at the moment

- **Devil May Cry 5** - *too many playable characters, but amazing graphics and cutscenes*
- **Deep Rock Galactic** - *kinda boring but it's the one coop game i'm playing atm*
- **Final Fantasy VII Remake** - *really slow but it's pure quality*
- **Elden Ring** - *probably one of the best games of all time*
