This is my log for most of the games I play.

(WIP) I have to fill this with more games. I have them logged somewhere else. It's a matter of moving what's there to here.


### 2023-12-07 - The Legend of Zelda - Echoes of Wisdom

(beaten in 20hs)

I loved the new mechanics in this Zelda game. It's a very adorable and comfy game to play with a lot of puzzles, and with a new twist to the gameplay. Only downsides are: It's too long, it gets too easy, and it doesn't go deep enough with its own mechanics, after a certain point in the game.

### 2024-12-23 - Inscryption

(beaten in 15hs)

An outstanding game. I am speechless. It rises above other indie games. It's very immersive and it manages to mix multiple game genres, all tied to an exciting plot. It may be my personal 2024 GOTY.

### 2025-01-07 - Bloodstained

(beaten in 17.1hs)

It's basically Castlevania - Symphony of the Night, but more modern. Lots of weapons to use. I enjoyed it a lot, but it was too long for me, for what it is. I had to force myself to beat it.
I got lost at times and I didn't enjoy that. I resorted to look up online where to go. But that's on me, I'm not a big fan of exploration.
It's goofy and sometimes rough around the edges, but it has its charm. It has the "indie feel". Some bosses felt unfair. There are some difficulty spikes that are tough to cross, but that's OK.
David Hayter is in this game!! I loved that.

### 2025-01-25 - Buckshot Roulette

(beaten in 30m) 
Small game I enjoyed a lot. Packed with style and it made me strategize a bit. Made in Godot!
