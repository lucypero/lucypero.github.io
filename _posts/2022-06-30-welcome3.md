This is my first blog post. I am on the process of building this website and making it pretty. Hope you come back when
it's more presentable!

Code test:

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::with_capacity(25);

    println!("{}", s.capacity());

    for _ in 0..5 {
        s.push_str("hello");
        println!("{}", s.capacity());
    }
}
```

Check out my [about](/about.html) page, I did finish that.
